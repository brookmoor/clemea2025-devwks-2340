## Introducing the Cisco Telemetry Broker (CTB) [DEVWKS-2340]

Welcome to this Devnet session on the Cisco Telemetry Broker.

The Cisco Telemetry Broker optimizes your telemetry pipelines for the hybrid cloud. It vastly simplifies the consumption of telemetry data for our customers' business critical tools by brokering hybrid cloud data, filtering unneeded data, and transforming data to a usable format for optimal consumption by the various analytics tools.

In this Lab, you will learn how to setup the Cisco Telemetry Broker to route telemetry from example sources to destinations and track the end-to-end flow of telemetry through the Telemetry Broker.
